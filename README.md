# Rantamuta Engine ("`core`")

Actual core engine code for [Rantamuta](https://github.com/Rantamuta) game engine which is a maintenance and stewardship fork of  [RanvierMUD](https://ranviermud.com).

The 1.0 release is intended to be a **pure maintenance upgrade**: updating the runtime to modern Node.js, adding CI via GitHub Actions, fixing long-standing crashes and sharp edges, and restoring a reliable out-of-the-box experience. There is no engine redesign and no intentional change to the core architecture.

## Support and Testing

Node 22 LTS is the supported runtime (see `engines.node` and `.nvmrc`).

Install dependencies with `npm ci` and run tests with `npm test`.

CI (GitHub Actions) runs on Node 22, installs with `npm ci`, runs `npm test`, and publishes a non-blocking `npm audit` report.

## Version lineage and compatibility

Rantamuta `v1.0.0` is a maintenance fork of RanvierMUD, cut at RanvierMUD `v3.0.6`.

At the time of the fork, Rantamuta `v1.0.0` is intended to be **behaviorally compatible** with the RanvierMUD `3.0.6` engine, with the primary differences being modernization work (Node.js 22 support, CI updates, dependency hygiene, and clearer error handling).

From `v1.0.0` onward, Rantamuta will evolve independently. Future releases may diverge in behavior while preserving backwards compatibility where practical.

## v1.2 Task list

These items are intentionally **post-1.0**. They remain within the Rantamuta stewardship model: no redesign, no feature work, no architectural shifts. Scope is limited to robustness, diagnostics, dependency risk reduction, and contract-locking tests.

### Runtime & Tooling

* [ ] Upgrade linting to be usable locally and in CI (ESLint + Prettier) with fix scripts.
* [ ] Remove legacy `.eslintrc` / `.jshintrc` and establish a clean default ESLint/Prettier baseline.
* [ ] Add `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix` scripts for local use.
* [ ] Add Prettier with `npm run format` and `npm run format:check`.
* [ ] Lint `src/`, `test/`, and root JS entry files without changing exports.
* [ ] Add `.git-blame-ignore-revs` for mechanical-only formatting commits.
* [ ] Wire CI to run lint/format checks only after formatting fixes land.

### Dependencies & Security Hygiene

* [ ] Narrowed legacy dependency review driven by concrete Node 22 incompatibilities or high-severity advisories.
* [ ] `winston@2`: decide upgrade or pin with explicit tests defining required logging behavior.
* [ ] `js-yaml@3`: decide upgrade or pin with YAML compatibility tests covering current engine usage.
* [ ] `wrap-ansi@2`: decide tolerate, upgrade, or pin if it contributes to install noise or Node incompatibility.
* [ ] `pretty-error`: decide keep, remove, or pin while preserving error presentation behavior.
* [ ] `require-dir`: lock in public export behavior with tests; replace only if forced.
* [ ] Dev-only transitive cleanup (e.g. `glob`, `inflight`) via tooling upgrades where feasible.
* [ ] Add non-blocking `npm audit` reporting in CI (summary or artifact only).

### CI & Quality Gates

* [ ] Add targeted contract tests for core subsystems (BundleManager, EntityLoader, registries, GameServer events).
* [ ] Add coverage reporting in CI (visibility first, thresholds optional and deferred).

### Stability & Error Handling

* [ ] Fail fast or surface explicit errors when `loadEntities` encounters invalid data (prefer opt-in strict mode).
* [ ] Surface missing area or entity scripts as explicit errors or via opt-in strict mode.
* [ ] Surface invalid help entries as errors or via opt-in strict mode.
* [ ] Add bundle, area, and entity context to warnings for missing scripts or invalid entity data.
* [ ] Detect missing loader registry entries (`areas`, `help`, etc.) early with explicit errors (or strict mode).
* [ ] Improve logging context in selected high-value core error paths without redesign.
* [ ] Preserve error cause chains when wrapping errors using `Error(..., { cause })` where supported.
* [ ] Add structured error boundaries in limited engine hotspots that add context and rethrow:
  * bundle loading paths
  * command dispatch
  * event dispatch
* [ ] Add targeted tests asserting:
  * wrapped errors preserve original `cause`
  * core does not import or depend on `longjohn` under default execution

### DX & Maintainability

* [x] Add unit tests for `DataSourceRegistry.load` and `EntityLoaderRegistry.load` validation rules.
* [ ] Add unit tests for `EntityLoader` method gating and error messages.
* [ ] Add tests for `BundleManager.loadBundles(distribute=false)` and `_getLoader` compatibility.
* [ ] Add tests for `EventManager.attach` / `detach` semantics and the `removeAllListeners` warning edge.
* [ ] Consolidate bundle path construction in `BundleManager` to reduce string-concat drift.
* [ ] Document and test async vs sync expectations in loader code paths before changing behavior.

### Documentation & Expectations

* [ ] Document expected synchronous filesystem usage in bundle loading and data utilities so consumers understand design intent.

## 1.1 Strict Mode

**Strict mode forbids overrides.** If any later bundle registers a key that is already registered, startup fails (throws) with an error identifying the registry, key, and both bundles. Strict mode is configured as a boolean with a default of `false` in `ranvier.json` or `ranvier.conf.js`

* [ ] Add a `strictMode` boolean to engine config resolution (`Config` defaults + `ranvier.json`/`ranvier.conf.js` merge) with default `false`, and thread the resolved value into `BundleManager` load flow without changing non-strict startup behavior.
* [ ] In `BundleManager`, add bundle-load registration tracking that records first writer metadata per registry key (registry name, key, bundle, optional source path) for every map-based registry populated during bundle loading.
* [ ] Define and use one duplicate handler in `BundleManager` (e.g., `_registerOrThrow`) that receives `{ registry, key, bundle, source }` and either records first writer or detects a later duplicate before the existing `add`/`set` call runs.
* [ ] Apply duplicate detection to command registrations in `loadCommands` for both `command.name` and each alias key written to `CommandManager.commands`.
* [ ] Apply duplicate detection to channel registrations in `loadChannels` for both `channel.name` and each alias key written to `ChannelManager.channels`.
* [ ] Apply duplicate detection to skill/spell registrations in `loadSkills` for keys written to `SkillManager.skills` and `SpellManager.skills` (skill `id`).
* [ ] Apply duplicate detection to effect registrations in `loadEffects` for keys written to `EffectFactory.effects`, so strict mode throws instead of allowing the current silent duplicate-ignore path.
* [ ] Apply duplicate detection to attribute registrations in `loadAttributes` for keys written to `AttributeFactory.attributes` (`attribute.name`).
* [ ] Apply duplicate detection to quest goal and quest reward registrations in `loadQuestGoals` / `loadQuestRewards` for keys written to `QuestGoalManager` and `QuestRewardManager`.
* [ ] Apply duplicate detection to helpfile registrations in `loadHelp` for keys written to `HelpManager.helps` (`help.name`).
* [ ] Apply duplicate detection to quest definition registrations in `loadQuests` for keys written to `QuestFactory.quests` (`area:id`).
* [ ] Apply duplicate detection to area/item/npc/room definition registrations in `loadArea` / `loadEntities` for keys written to `AreaFactory.entities` and `EntityFactory.entities` (`areaName` and `area:id`).
* [ ] When `strictMode === true`, throw immediately on first duplicate with a clear startup error message including: registry name, duplicated key, first bundle, second bundle; wrap with loading context only if existing error-wrapping conventions require it.
* [ ] When `strictMode === false`, keep current behavior exactly: last-write-wins registries still override, `EffectFactory.add` duplicate-ignore remains unchanged, and no new warnings or startup failures are introduced.
* [ ] Add focused tests covering strict on/off behavior for each registry group above, including assertion that strict mode failure stops startup and the thrown message includes registry, key, and conflicting bundle names.

### Stopping conditions

v1.1 is complete and releasable when strict mode can be toggled from config, duplicates across all listed bundle-loaded map registries fail fast with the required error details in strict mode, non-strict mode remains behaviorally unchanged, and automated tests cover both paths.

## 1.0 Maintenance Checklist

This checklist is scoped to the `Rantamuta/core` engine only. It focuses on a **pure maintenance upgrade**: modern Node.js compatibility, CI, dependency hygiene, and sharp-edge fixes. There is no redesign, no API-breaking changes, and no assumptions about `ranviermud`, datasources, or bundles.

The tasks in this checklist describe the work required to bring the RanvierMUD core engine at version **v3.0.6** to a **behaviorally equivalent**, modernized state released as **Rantamuta v1.0.0**.

### Modernization

#### Runtime & Tooling

* [x] Node runtime target set to `>=22` in `package.json` (`engines.node`).
* [x] `.nvmrc` pins Node `v22.21.1` for local dev parity.
* [x] CommonJS module format retained (`index.js` + `require-dir`, no `type: "module"`).
* [x] Lockfile v3 present (`package-lock.json`).
* [x] `npm test` script defined (mocha + c8).
* [x] GitHub Actions CI present.
* [x] CI installs via `npm ci`.
* [x] CI currently runs on Node 22.
* [x] Remove or update legacy `.travis.yml` (still targets Node 10).

#### Dependencies & Security Hygiene

* [x] `longjohn`: Remove `longjohn` from dependencies (divestment, not gating)
  * Rationale: high runtime overhead, legacy async instrumentation, and ongoing compatibility risk on modern Node.
  * Replacement is documentation and adoption of modern Node diagnostics and improved contextual error reporting.
  * [x] Define when/where it is used and what behavior it provides
  * [x] Add one or two targeted tests that assert core does not depend on `longjohn` (and does not import it) under default execution
  * [x] Document recommended Node diagnostics for development debugging (replace “long async stacks” approach):
    * `--trace-uncaught`
    * `--trace-warnings`
    * inspector-based debugging (`node --inspect` / DevTools workflow)

* [x] `glob` / `inflight` (and similar): removed inflight by upgrading mocha to latest and overriding `glob` to latest.

* [x] Add non-blocking `npm audit` reporting in CI (artifact or summary).

#### Packaging & Distribution

* [x] `main` points to `index.js` (require-dir export surface preserved).
* [x] Entry point remains CommonJS and stable.
* [x] Document in `docs/NOTES.md` that `require-dir('./src/')` exposes all `src/*` modules as public API.
* [x] Remove npm packaging artifacts and references (e.g., `.npmignore`, `npm pack`, publish-focused docs) since this repo is not distributed as an npm package.

#### CI & Quality Gates

* [x] Unit test framework present (mocha) with coverage tooling (c8).
* [x] Unit tests exist in `test/unit` for utility modules.

#### Documentation

* [x] README states “pure maintenance upgrade” intent.
* [x] Supported Node versions: Node 22 LTS (see `engines.node` and `.nvmrc`).
* [x] Document supported Node versions (22 now).
* [x] Document in `docs/NOTES.md` the core‑only scope, extension points, and public API surface (Config, Logger, BundleManager, EntityLoader, GameServer).
* [x] Document in `docs/NOTES.md` sharp edges and failure modes (Config load order, BundleManager exit paths, EventManager detach behavior).
* [x] Establish in `docs/NOTES.md` a lightweight changelog policy for maintenance releases (record user-visible changes and dependency/security actions).
  * Scope: dependency upgrades/removals, runtime/CI changes, compatibility-impacting fixes, and removals of debugging hooks.
  * Format can be minimal (single `CHANGELOG.md` or “changelog entries in PR description”), but it must be consistent.

---

#### Stability & Error Handling

* [x] Replace `process.exit(0)` in `BundleManager` error paths with thrown errors or non-zero exit codes (library should not hard-exit).
* [x] Log loader errors in `loadQuests` instead of swallowing them silently.
* [x] Surface `loadQuests` loader exceptions instead of ignoring `fetchAll()` errors that can mask quest data issues.
* [x] Validate `loadInputEvents` exports with clearer errors that identify the bundle and event name when `event` is not a function.
* [x] Add bundle/area/entity context to warnings for missing scripts or invalid entity data, only if trivial context addition without changing control flow. Otherwise, cross off this item.
* [x] Guard `Config.get` against being called before `Config.load` (clear error or safe fallback).
* [x] Improve error messages in `Data.saveFile`/`Data.parseFile` with full path and action context.

## Developing

* Have a checkout of the normal ranviermud repo
* Have a checkout of this repo adjacent to it
* In this repo run npm install then `npm link` (might need `sudo`)
* Go back to the other repo and run `npm link ranvier`

Now any changes you make in this repo will automatically be available inside your ranvier project. Any time you do `npm
install` or `npm update` in your ranviermud repository you'll have to re-run `npm link ranvier` to re-establish the link.
