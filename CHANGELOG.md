## Unreleased

### Quest loader error surfacing
- Summary:
  - `BundleManager.loadQuests` now surfaces loader failures instead of returning a silent empty list.
- Why:
  - Avoids masking quest data errors during bundle loading so failures are actionable.
- Impact:
  - Bundle load will fail fast if quest loaders throw; downstream loaders must handle or fix invalid quest data.
- Migration/Action:
  - Ensure quest loader data is valid; handle thrown errors where bundle loading is invoked if needed.

### Data file error context
- Summary:
  - Added action-specific error messages for `Data.parseFile` and `Data.saveFile` that include full file paths.
- Why:
  - Improves diagnostics for missing files or unsupported extensions during data load/save operations.
- Impact:
  - Users will see clearer error messages that distinguish parse vs. save failures.
- Migration/Action:
  - None.

  - PR: pending

### Config pre-load guard
- Summary:
  - Added an explicit pre-load guard for `Config.get` with a dedicated error type.
- Why:
  - Prevent ambiguous null access errors and make config lifecycle violations explicit.
- Impact:
  - Callers invoking `Config.get` before `Config.load` now receive a clear error instead of a generic runtime failure.
- Migration/Action:
  - Ensure `Config.load` is called before any `Config.get` usage.

### Remove `sty` dependency
- Summary:
  - Replaced RanvierMUD's `sty` dependency with a homegrown color tag parser.
- Why:
  - `sty` is no longer supported and has long-standing, critical security issues. DIY parser `Ansi.js` added to reduce dependency surface and align color parsing with engine-specific needs.
- Impact:
  - Downstream code that relied on `sty` behaviors should use the core color tag parser instead.
- Migration/Action:
  - Update downstream logging or formatting to use the core color tag format where applicable.
